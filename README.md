# AI Agent Stack

## Overview
The AI Agent Stack is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed for coordinating AI operations with intelligent task detection and automatic objective promotion. This system provides a robust framework for managing AI agents, tasks, and resources in a distributed environment.

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Task Detection & Management**
- **Automatic Objective Promotion**
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**
- **Real-time Monitoring & Health Checks**
- **Advanced Resource Management**
- **Robust Error Handling & Recovery**
