A modular AI orchestration framework enabling scalable, fault-tolerant, and intelligent task execution across distributed systems. The AI Agent Stack revolutionizes multi-agent coordination through intelligent task detection, automatic objective promotion, and robust resource management.

## Overview
The AI Agent Stack is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed for coordinating AI operations with intelligent task detection and automatic objective promotion. This system provides a robust framework for managing AI agents, tasks, and resources in a distributed environment.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wowwaow/devstack.git
cd devstack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
vim .env  # Edit configuration as needed

# Initialize and start the system
python initialize.py
python run_agents.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Starting Agent Manager
```python
from agent_stack import AgentManager

# Initialize with custom configuration
manager = AgentManager(
    num_agents=5,
    task_poll_interval=60,
    health_check_interval=300
)

# Start agent operations
manager.start()

# Submit a new task
task = manager.submit_task({
    'type': 'data_processing',
    'priority': 'high',
    'parameters': {'source': 'logs/system.log'}
})

# Monitor task status
status = manager.get_task_status(task.id)
print(f"Task {task.id} status: {status}")
```

### Using the CLI
```bash
# Start the agent system
devstack start --agents 5

# Monitor system status
devstack status

# View agent logs
devstack logs --agent-id ABC123
```
